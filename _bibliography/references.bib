	abstract = {This survey paper discusses the fundamentals of power systems modelling in the presence of large amounts of converter-interfaced generation (CIG). By referring to real-life events characterised by anomalous dynamics associated to the presence of CIG, the concepts of narrow versus broad band signals are first recalled along with the limitation of the meaning of apparent power, power factor and reactive power. In this regard, the adequacy of the phasor representation of voltages and currents waveforms is thoroughly discussed. Then, with respect to the central subject of control of power converters, a revised definition of grid-following and grid-forming converters is provided along with a thorough discussion of their associated controls and a comprehensive classification for both classes of converters. Several applications inspired by actual case studies are included in the paper in order to provide realistic application examples.},

This solver primarily targets co-simulation applications and large-scale scenarios since dynamic phasors do not require sampling rates as high as EMT simulations do. Due to the frequency shift introduced by the dynamic phasor approach, the sampling rate and rate of data exchange between simulators can be reduced. DPsim supports the Common Information Model (CIM) format for the description of electrical network topology, component parameters and power flow data and it is closely integrated with the VILLASframework to support a wide range of interfaces for co-simulation.

	abstract = {Real-time simulation is an increasingly popular tool for product development and research in power systems. However, commercial simulators are still quite exclusive due to their costs and they face problems in bridging the gap between two common types of power system simulation, conventional phasor based, and electromagnetic transient simulation. This work describes recent improvements to the open source real-time simulator DPsim to address increasingly important use cases that involve power electronics that are connected to the electrical grid and increasing grid sizes. New power electronic models have been developed and integrated into the DPsim simulator together with techniques to decouple the system solution, which facilitate parallelization. The results show that the dynamic phasors in DPsim, which result from shifted frequency analysis, allow the user to combine the characteristics of conventional phasor and electromagnetic transient simulation. Besides, simulation speed up techniques that are known from the electromagnetic domain and new techniques, speciﬁc to dynamic phasors, signiﬁcantly improve the performance. It demonstrates the advantages of dynamic phasor simulation for future power systems and the applicability of this concept to large scale scenarios.},

The simulation scenario covers the connection of a distributed generation unit to a distribution system with a single local load. Symmetrical short circuits and fault ride-through of the distributed generation unit are simulated and short-term voltage stability is evaluated using EMT and RMS (phasor type) simulation models. A detailed EMT model is compared to a RMS model based on average value modeling with fully represented control system and to a simplified RMS model. Differences between the three models are evaluated based on dynamic quantities of currents and voltages as well as the critical clearing times for the prevention of voltage collapse. Influence of grid impedance and control behavior of the converter on the critical clearing times are analyzed and compared for each model. Results show resemblance of stationary and disparity of transient behavior for weak, inductive grids with slight overestimation of critical clearing time by both RMS models.},

Moreover, the inﬂuence on transient and frequency stability is studied brieﬂy. To evaluate FIDVR, a novel metric, the socalled Voltage Recovery Index (VRI), is deﬁned. The studies are performed with the WECC generic PV system model on an IEEE voltage stability test system, namely the Nordic test system. The results show that without LVRT capability the system is ST voltage and transient unstable. Only the LVRT and DVS capability help to avoid ST voltage and transient instability. Considering voltage and frequency dynamics, an active current recovery rate of 100 \%/s shows the best performance. To further enhance voltage dynamics, plant-level voltage control together with local coordinated reactive power/voltage control should be applied. Moreover, the VRI provides useful information about the FIDVR and helps to compare different ST voltage controls.},

The distance in load power parameter space to this locally closest bifurcation is an index of voltage collapse. The pattern of load power increase need not be predicted; instead the index is a worst cage load power margin. The computations are illustrated in the 6 dimensional load power parameter space of a 5 bus power system. The normal vector and curvature of a hypersurface' of critical load powers a t which bifurcation occurs are also computed. The sensitivity of the index to parameters and controls is easily obtained from the normal vector.},

This paper proposes a general stability analysis method to measure the dynamic stability of grid connected VSC-HVDC system from the point of view of input to state stability (ISS). A nonlinear time-varying discrete-time state space model (NTDS2M) of the grid connected VSC-HVDC system is built considering the impact of the time-varying phase shift. Then, the NTDS2M is decomposed into several interconnected subsystems. The general asymptotic gain matrix (GAGM), whose elements are derived from the proposed dissipative-form sum-type inequalities (DSIs), is constructed to quantify the interactions between multiple subsystems. Finally, a general dynamic stability analysis index, called dynamic short circuit ratio (DSCR), is proposed to effectively explain the critical dynamic instability point of the grid connected VSC-HVDC system, based on the spectral radius property of the GAGM. Moreover, the real-time simulations and multiple comparative studies are implemented in this paper to verify the effectiveness of the proposed NTDS2M and stability analysis method by using RT-LAB platform.},

However, it is still unclear if phasor models can still be used in fault studies in modern or future power grids dominated by renewable generation with power electronics and converters. Therefore, this paper analyses the suitability of phasor models to simulate short-circuit transients in grids with grid-following (GFL) and grid-forming (GFM) voltage-source converters (VSC). Phasor models of GFL and GFM were developed and tested in two test systems, one with 50\% of converters in the generation mix and another powered 100\% by converters. Asymmetrical and symmetrical faults were applied at different points of the systems and key variables were used to compare the phasor models against EMT models during the transients. The results showed that, despite neglecting transients in the grid, phasor models could be used in a preliminary stage of short-circuit studies as it was capable of tracking the steady-state value of almost all variables analysed. In this case, detailed EMT simulations, although necessary, would be used only at more advanced stages of the studies.},

	abstract = {Converter-based generators are increasingly replacing classical synchronous generation, resulting in signiﬁcant challenges to the operation and planning of modern power systems. Power electronics (PE)-based equipment, along with non-linear PE-driven loads, introduce time-varying characteristics and fast switching behavior that increases the complexity of the power system model. Faster control actions are needed to overcome the fast switching dynamics to ensure the reliability and stability of future power systems. Thus, this requires advanced and detailed simulation methods and tools with highly accurate equivalent models to embody the relatively slower electromechanical to faster electromagnetic transient (EMT) phenomena. Conventional transient stability analysis using positive-sequence simulators has become inadequate for representing converter-dominated power systems, while EMT simulators suffer from the high computational burden. This review paper presents accelerated EMT simulation methods and tools that are categorized and discussed in three topics: system equivalents, simulation methods, and accelerating tools. Dynamic system equivalent techniques are discussed to model small to large interconnected external systems of the grid network. Moreover, a systematic review is made for existing EMT simulation methods, along with advanced co-simulation methods, for addressing simulation speed and accuracy issues in large power system networks. Emerging hardware-based simulation tools are reviewed that reduce the computational burden and increase the simulation efﬁciency of the power system model. Challenges and trends in EMT simulation are also presented and concluded by providing perspectives on this research topic.},

	abstract = {Power system stability is widely assessed based on tools that rely on the representation of voltages and currents through quasi-static phasor calculus, implying that the network itself and the synchronous machine stators are modeled by algebraic equations. Accordingly, the associated fast transients are neglected, assuming those decay rapidly. However, with the increasing penetration of converter interfaced generation in power systems, the reliance on quasi-static phasor calculus is to be questioned. In this paper, the validity of quasi-static phasor calculus models is veriﬁed, and dynamic phasor calculus is considered as the alternative. A methodology to systematically compare quasi-static and dynamic phasor calculus is developed. It includes frequency response, modal, and sensitivity analyses. The methodology is applied to an IEEE test network considering penetrations of converter interfaced generation of up to 100\%. The models are implemented in MATLAB. The H-inﬁnity norm is proposed as an indicator to identify differences in the applicability of the models. The results show that the quasi-static phasor calculus is suitable for stability analysis only if low bandwidths of converter controls are given. Dynamic phasor calculus instead is suitable and applicable to generic stability studies of integrated power electric and electronic systems with high penetration of renewables.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to outline the challenges found during the verification process for simulation model performance in several commercial RMS and EMT simulation tools required by ERCOT. These challenges are categorized into 2 main groups: Simulation Tool Limitations (STL) and Simulation Model Simplification (SMS). STL covers intrinsic conditions of RMS tools when compared to EMT tools like software solver, time step, acceleration factor. SMS’s consist of simplifications used for the model development in a RMS environment, to adapt to phasor domain calculation and longer simulation time steps. The paper highlights the lessons learned, recommended practices, and underlying reasons for discrepancies when benchmarking simulation results from RMS tools against EMT tools. Finally, the paper elaborates how Vestas’s solution overcomes the challenges by using a full code integrated model called, based on the original control developed by the different Vestas design teams for both wind turbine and power plant controller products, which is shared between RMS and EMT tools and maintains a 1-to-1 parametrization with the real product. The model scrutiny process for ERCOT is positively impacting the quality of models for other markets.},

As a consequence, is often unclear when to use EMT or Phasor models in grid integration studies. Therefore, this paper presents useful simulation guidelines of Voltage-Source Converters (VSCs) used in AC grid integration studies. It also presents several EMT and Phasor models suited to simulate CIG and renewable energy resources connected to power systems. Several modelling approaches and suitability analyses were provided based on a comprehensive comparative study among the models. Various studies were performed in a small system, composed of two generators, and a CIGRE benchmark system, both modelled in Simulink. We address a gap related to the suitability of CIGs phasor models in studies where the boundary between electromagnetic and electromechanical transients overlap. An insightful analysis of the adequate simulation time step for each model and study is also provided.},

	abstract = {Time-domain simulations are a critical tool for power system operators. Depending on the instability mechanism under consideration and the system characteristics, such as the time constants of controllers, either phasor or ElectroMagnetic Transient (EMT) models should be employed. On the one hand, EMT models provide a detailed-modeling of the system dynamics, thus increase the reliability of stability analysis; on the other end, using these models increase the computational times of simulations, slowing down the security assessment process. To decrease computational time, system operators could resort to phasor-mode simulations for a (hopefully large) subset of disturbances. This paper investigates the appropriateness of phasor-approximation models on simulating events related to power supply and balance stability in zero-inertia systems. First, the stability boundaries, which each model is able to identify, are analyzed; then sufﬁcient conditions for control parameters are derived, which allow using phasor-approximation models to monitor power sharing among grid-forming converter-based resources. Time-domain simulations are performed in PowerFactory DigSilent to verify the results.},

This entails interpolating over time the phasors of the PM simulation, extracting phasors from the time evolutions of the EMT simulation, and representing each sub-system by a proper multiport equivalent when simulating the other sub-system. Various equivalents are reviewed and compared in terms of convergence of the PM-EMT iterations. The paper also considers the update with frequency of the Thévenin impedances involved in the EMT simulation, the possibility to compute the EMT solution only once per time step, and the acceleration of convergence through a prediction over time of the boundary variables. Results are presented on a 74-bus, 23-machine test system, split into one EMT and one PM sub-system with several interface buses.},

To do this, first, a detailed modal analysis is carried out to understand the evolution of the system’s modes as VGTs increases.

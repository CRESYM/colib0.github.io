## Context

The Phasor-$$I_1$$ Grid Following Voltage Source Converter (VSC) model [[1]](#1) is derived from the [Full-Phasor](../). 

## Model use, assumptions, validity domain and limitations

The model can be used to fasten the simulations for low-frequency phenomena studies. If the simulation step size is desired to be close to the dynamics of the current control loop (around $$10^3$$ $$\mu s$$), the Phasor-$$I_1$$ model performs better than the Full-Phasor model, which will have an important increase of the error (or even divergence) when using these step sizes.

The assumptions made starting from the Full-Phasor model are the following:

* The current loop is substituted by a first-order transfer function with a given time constant.

The model shows a performance close to more accurate models during for slow dynamics such as setpoint tracking or voltage/frequency deviation. It can solve high frequency phenomena with clear limitations, as the results do not capture correctly the dynamics of phenomena like asymmetrical faults.

Although it allows a bigger time step than the Full-Phasor model, it eventually will diverge if it is increased too much, as it still retains some dynamics in an approximate way. The Phasor-$$I_0$$ model is more suitable as it completely removes the current loop dynamics.

## Model description

The diagram of the complete model is shown in the following figure.

The following subsections will describe the changes with respect to the Full-Phasor model.

### Current loop

The differential equations that modelled the behavior of the current loop are substituted by a first-order transfer function with a given time constant:

<div style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:center; vertical-align: middle; padding:4px 0;">

$$ \frac{i_c^{qd*}}{i^{qd*}} = \frac{1}{1 + \tau_c s}$$
</div>

where $$\tau_c = \frac{1}{w_c}$$ is the time constant of the current loop, being $$w_c$$ the frequency that is set to match the bandwidth of the original  current loop. 


### Outer loop

No changes are made directly to this outer-loop, although the time constant $$\tau_c$$ will act as a low-pass filter of the current setpoint provided by the outer loop.

## Context

The Phasor-$$I_0$$ Grid Following Voltage Source Converter (VSC) model is derived from the [Full-Phasor](../). 

## Model use, assumptions, validity domain and limitations

The model has uses similar to the $$I_1$$ model, with some improvement in the simulation speed while the precision is slightly reduced.

The assumptions made starting from the Full-Phasor model are the following:

* The current loop is completely removed from the model. The current obtained from the outer loop is directly considered to be provided by the VSC.
* Since there are no current dynamics, the outer loop is modified to maintain the closed-loop from the Full-Phasor model.

The model is valid for low-frequency phenomena studies, similarly to the Phasor-I1 model, but it allows for bigger time-steps (around 2 or 3 times greater time-step size). The medium to high-frequency events ($$>100$$ Hz) are not captured as well as in the Full-Phasor model for instance. 

## Model description

The diagram of the complete model is shown in the following figure.

The following subsections will describe the changes with respect to the Full-Phasor model.

### Current loop

The block is completely removed, which means $$i^{qd*} = i^{qd*}_c $$.

### Outer loop

The outer loop, or power loop, has to be adapted since it had the dynamics of the current loop included in its transfer function. The closed-loop transfer function of the outer loop is:

<div style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:center; vertical-align: middle; padding:4px 0;">

$$ C_{pq}(s) = \frac{G_{pq}(s)}{1 + G_{pq}(s)} = \frac{1}{1+\tau_{pq}s} $$

</div>

where $$\tau_{pq} = \frac{1}{\omega_{pq}}$$ is the time constant of the original outer loop. The new open-loop transfer function, which does not include the current loop dynamics, is:

<div style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:center; vertical-align: middle; padding:4px 0;">

$$ G_{pq}(s) = K_{pq}(s)\frac{3}{2}v_g^{q} $$

</div>

where $$v_g^{q}$$ can be considered to be $$V_peak$$. The controller is then:

<div style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:center; vertical-align: middle; padding:4px 0;">

$$ K_{pq}(s) = \frac{2}{3V_{peak}} \frac{1}{\tau_{pq}s} $$

</div>

# Synchronous Machine SM1 Model

## Context

The synchronous machine is one of the most studied component of a power system, being its main source of electrical energy. It is the most common type of generators, and it is present in conventional power plants that use a turbine to transfer the energy of steam into mechanical energy. These generators transform this mechanical energy into electric energy. The mathematical model presented, will allow to perform steady-state and transient analysis of round rotor synchronous machines.[[1]](#1)

## Model use, assumptions, validity domain and limitations

The model is a basic representation of the synchronous machine and can be used to study three-phase synchronous machine for its steady-state. DYnamic studies can be visited in the models SM2 and SM3, which are obtained working the basic equations of this model and the study of the magnetic coupling between the windings. 

This model assumes that the rotation of the magnetic field is sinusoidal, the resistance losses are negligible in front of the inductances and a separation of 120ยบ between each of the three phases poles.

It is valid for round rotor synchronous generators, generally used for operations with high speed turbines such as the ones in conventional power plants. Salient pole synchronous machines, used in lower speed applications such as hydro power, are out of the domain of the model.

### Physical parts of a Synchronous Machine

A sychronous machine is formed by the following parts:

#### Rotor

The rotor is the moving part of the generator. It is at the end of the rotation axis of the turbine, which is the component that transfers the energy of a moving fluid (normally steam) into mechanical energy.
As the name indicates, the mechanical energy corresponds to the rotational kinetic energy of the body compossed by the blades and axis of the turbine. <!-- Add inertia information>
It can be round rotor, commonly used in high rotation speed application, or salient pole, used in lower speed applications (i.e. hydro generation) where multiple pair of poles are needed to work at the grid frequency.[[2]](#2) The windings axis will be pointing in a perpendicular direction to the turbine axis, and will rotate with the rotor. This winding will have a current generated by the exciter that will produce a rotating magnetic field ($$\phi_f$$). 

#### Exciter

The exciter is the source of power that generates the current flowing through the rotor winding. It applies a DC voltage $$E_f$$ that generates a current in the rotor winding, creating an electromagnet. 

#### Stator

It is the static part of the machine, as its name indicates. This structure gives physical support to the whole machine, while it tipically contains the armature winding. It is a three-phase winding distributed in a circular cavity 120ยบ apart one from each other. The uniform rotation of the magnetic field created by the rotor winding will generate currents at each winding 120ยบ apart in the phasorial space. The instantaneous value for each phase is noted as $$i_a$$, $$i_b$$, and $$i_c$$[[2]](#2).

#### Governor

The governor is the controller of the speed of the motor. It will ensure that the frequency of the rotation is maintained at the setpoint, which is the grid frequency.
The control will be done by changing the amount of steam entering in the turbine, increasing or decreasing the rate of steam depending on the error signal. 

### Operational principles

The dynamic equation that governs the system relates the mechanical torque applied by the turbine and the electrical torque applied by the grid[[3]](#3):

<div style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:center; vertical-align: middle; padding:4px 0;">

$$J\frac{2}{p_f}  \frac{d\omega}{dt} = T_m - T_e - T_{fw}$$
</div>

where $$J$$ is the inertia of the rotating body, $$T_m$$ is the mechanical torque, $$T_e$$ is the electrical torque and $$T_{fw}$$ is the friction and windage torque.

Regarding the electrical part of the model, the rotor winding is magnetized by the exciter current, creating a magnetic field that will rotate with the rotor's angular velocity. As it spins, the stator windings will be subjected to a variable magnetic flux caused by the rotation of the produced magnetic field which, according to Faraday's Law, will induce a current in the windings.

The rotational speed of the rotor of a syncrhonous machine is proportional to the grid frequency times the number of poles (i.e. number of different three-phase windings). The induced field $$e_f$$ will lead the terminal voltage $$v_t$$ by a load angle denoted as $$\delta$$.

<div style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:center; vertical-align: middle; padding:4px 0;">
$$n = \frac{120f}{p_f}$$

</div>

where $$n$$ is the rotational speed in rev/min, $$f$$ is the stator currents frequency in Hz, and $$p_f$$ is the number of field poles.

The equivalent circuit that describes the synchronous generator is[[2]](#2):

     alt="Operation of a Synchronous Machine schematic"
     style="float: center; width: 400px;" />

</p>

<div style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:center; vertical-align: middle; padding:4px 0;">

$$v_t = e_f - j i_a X_s - i_a R_a \approx e_f - j i_a X_s$$

</div>
where $$v_t$$ is the voltage at the terminals of the stator winding $$a$$, $$e_f$$ is the induced electromotive force by the magnetic field rotation, $$X_s = X_a + X_l$$ is the total reactance of the generator, which is obtained by adding the armature and the leakage reactance, $$R_a$$ is the series resistance, which can be neglected in front of the reactance effects, and $$i_a$$ is the current through the $$a$$ winding.

For a balanced system and considering $$t=0$$ the instant where $$i_a$$ is maximum, we have:

<div style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:center; vertical-align: middle; padding:4px 0;">

$$i_a = I_m\cos(2\pi f t)$$

$$i_b = I_m\cos(2\pi f t - \frac{2\pi}{3})$$

$$i_c = I_m\cos(2\pi f t + \frac{2\pi}{3})$$
</div>

For dynamic studies of the syncrhonous machine, it is convinient to make use of the dq0 transformation, which will yield the expressions of the currents in the rotating reference frame of the AC waveforms[[1]](#1):

<div style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:center; vertical-align: middle; padding:4px 0;">
$$\begin{bmatrix} i_q \\\ i_d \\\ i_0 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{2}{3} \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta) & \cos(\theta - \frac{2\pi}{3}) & \cos(\theta + \frac{2\pi}{3}) \\\ -\sin(\theta) & -\sin(\theta - \frac{2\pi}{3}) & -\sin(\theta + \frac{2\pi}{3}) \\\ \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix} i_a \\\ i_b \\\ i_c \end{bmatrix}$$
</div>

The synchronous machine can be operated to provide constant active power while using the excitation to control the reactive power, with $$P = \lvert v_t \rvert \lvert i_a \rvert \cos(\theta) = constant$$. We can also consider an operation with fixed excitation and variable power. The following images show the effect on the induced current $$i_a$$ [[2]](#2):

<img src="{{'/pages/models/generations/SM1/SM_fixed_ef.svg' | relative_url }}"
     alt="Phasorial map of the operation with fixed excitation"
     style="width: 350px;" />

</p>

Left image shows different excitation levels for constant power operation. In normal excitation, $$\lvert e_f \rvert \cos(\delta) = \lvert v_t \rvert$$, and the current and voltage of the stator is in phase, meaning that the power factor $$\cos(\theta) = 1$$. In over or underexcitation, the current lags or leads the voltage respectively, providing or drawing reactive power from the grid respectively.

Right image shows that for constant excitation, a greater torque angle $$\delta$$ improves the power factor. This torque angle is increased by increasing the load of the generator.

### Operational limits

Depending on the difference in phase between the rotor and grid rotation, the power transfered will be composed of active ($$P$$) and reactive ($$Q$$) power.

These generated powers are limited by the heat limits of the components of the generator. The limits considered are the Armature and field current limit, due to Joule effect heating of both windings, and end region heating limit, which occurs due to currents in the structure of the stator when the field is underexcited.

The following charts show the capability and compound curves for different power factors[[1]](#1).

The left chart shows the $$P$$ and $$Q$$ maximum values for differnt limit curves, which depend on the refrigerator used, while the right chart shows the dependency on exciter current and apparent power for different values of the power factor.

Syntax:

Internal states : none

Discrete variable : none

## Equations

This block forces an algebraic constraint (or equation) involving one of several states :
$$f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)= 0$$
where $n$ is the number of system states ($n \geq 1$)

**N.B.**
Note that this blocks does not really have “inputs” and “outputs”. The latter stem from the rest of the model involving the algebraic constraint.

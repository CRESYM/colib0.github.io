## Context

Motors are a particular kind of load that can account for a large share of the total load especially in industrialised countries. Adequate representation of motors is important, especially in short-term voltage stability studies as motors can cause fault-induced delayed voltage recovery.

## Model use, assumptions, validity domain and limitations

The motor model can be used for short-term voltage stability studies. The assumptions made for this model are:

* The rotor resistance is constant (no skin-effect or double-cage motors).
* The motor is balanced.
* The magnetic circuit is considered to be linear, neglecting saturation effects.
* The mechanical torque varies as a constant power of the rotor speed (e.g. constant torque or quadratic torque).

The model takes into account transient and subtransient phenomena and is therefore suitable for systems with a very large motor share (>50% of the total load) or to compute the short-circuit contribution from motors.

And is interfaced to the grid with

<div style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:center; vertical-align: middle; padding:4px 0;">

$$V = (E_d'' + j E_q'') + (R_s + j L_{pp}) (I_d + j I_q)$$

</div>

And the mechanical equations are

<div style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0470588); text-align:center; vertical-align: middle; padding:4px 0;">

$$2 J  \frac{d\omega}{dt} = C_e - C_l$$
$$SLIP = \frac{\omega_s - \omega}{\omega_s}$$
$$C_e = E_d'' I_d + E_q'' I_q$$
$$C_l = C_{l, 0} \left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_0}\right)^\eta$$

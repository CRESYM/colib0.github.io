## Context

Motors are a particular kind of load that can account for a large share of the total load especially in industrialised countries. Adequate representation of motors is important, especially in short-term voltage stability studies as motors can cause fault-induced delayed voltage recovery. This page presents a single-cage induction motor model based on the textbook three-phase induction motor equivalent circuit [[1]](#1).

## Model use, assumptions, validity domain and limitations

The motor model can be used for short-term voltage stability studies. The assumptions made for this model are:

* The rotor resistance is constant (no skin-effect or double-cage motors).
* The motor is balanced.
* The magnetic circuit is considered to be linear, neglecting saturation effects.
* The mechanical torque varies as a constant power of the rotor speed (e.g. constant torque or quadratic torque).

The model does not take into account transient and subtransient phenomena and is therefore not suitable for systems with a very large motor share (>50% of the total load) or to compute the short-circuit contribution from motors.

## Model description

The model is based on the equivalent circuit represented below.

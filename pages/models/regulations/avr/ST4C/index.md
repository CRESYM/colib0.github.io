# Exc IEEE ST4C model

This article is incomplete, some sections must be written.

## Context

This voltage regulator model first appeared in the IEEE Std 421.5-2016 {% cite IEEEExciterModels2016 %}. It has been reproduced identically in the IEC 61970-302:2024 version {% cite IECCIMForDynamics2024 %}.
In the previous standard version (2005), its predecessor model was called ST4B. Compared to ST4B, ST4C has additional options for connecting OEL and UEL inputs, an additional block with time constant tA and an additional time constant tG in the feedback path with gain Kg.

## Model inputs and output

The input variables are :

| Variable | Description | Units |
|-----------|--------------| ------|
|IrPu |rotor current |pu (base SNom, user-selected base voltage)|
|itPu |complex current at the terminal |pu (base SNom, UNom)|
|UsPu |measured stator voltage |pu (base UNom)|

## Model variant

In the ST4B model :

- the overexcitation limiter voltage is applied in the inner loop field regulator
- the voltages from the underexcitation limiter and the power system stabilizer are added to the voltage error
- there is no stator current limiter
- the power source is derived from terminal voltage
- there are no first order filter and no upper limit for the feedback signal of the inner loop field regulator

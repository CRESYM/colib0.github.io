# Exc IEEE AC1C model

## Context

This voltage regulator model first appeared in the IEEE Std 421.5-2016 {% cite IEEEExciterModels2016 %}. It has been reproduced identically in the IEC 61970-302:2024 version {% cite IECCIMForDynamics2024 %}.
In previous standard versions (1992, 2005), its predecessor model was called AC1A. Compared to AC1A, AC1C has additional options for connecting OEL and UEL inputs and limits on the rotating exciter model.

This model is part of the alternator supplied rectifier excitation systems that use an ac alternator and stationary or rotating rectifies to produce generator field requirements.

## Model use, assumptions, validity domain and limitations

These excitation systems consist of an alternator main exciter feeding its output via non-controlled rectifiers. The exciter does not employ self-excitation, and the voltage regulator power is taken from a source that is not affected by external transients.

It takes into account loading effects. It can't allow the supply of negative field current. It takes into account saturation.

This model is satisfactory for large scale simulations. However, if this model is used to design phase lead networks for power system stabilizers, and the local mode is close to 3 Hz or higher, a more detailed treatment of the ac rotating exciter may be needed.

Excitation systems incorporating rotating machines produce a field voltage output ($$E_{FD}$$) which is proportional to the rotating speed of the machine. Since this effect is negligible when speed deviations are small which is the case of dynamic studies of large interconnected power systems, the effect of speed deviations on the output of the dc rotating exciter models is not represented in this latest version of the standard. However, some commercial software may have implemented such speed dependency in their model.

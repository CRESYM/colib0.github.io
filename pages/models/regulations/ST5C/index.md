## Context

This voltage regulator model first appeared in the IEEE Std 421.5-2016 {% cite IEEEExciterModels2016 %}. It has been reproduced identically in the IEC 61970-302:2024 version {% cite IECCIMForDynamics2024 %}.
In the previous standard version (2005), its predecessor model was called ST5B. Compared to ST5B, ST5C has additional options for connecting OEL and UEL inputs.

## Model inputs and output

The input variables are :

| Variable | Description | Units |
|-----------|--------------| ------|
|IrPu |rotor current |pu (base SNom, user-selected base voltage)|
|UsPu |measured stator voltage |pu (base UNom)|
|UsRefPu |reference stator voltage |pu (base UNom)|
|UOelPu (optional) |output voltage of overexcitation limiter |pu (base UNom)|
|UPssPu (optional) |output voltage of power system stabilizer |pu (base UNom)|
|USclOelPu (optional) |output voltage of stator current overexcitation limiter |pu (base UNom)|
|USclUelPu (optional) |output voltage of stator current underexcitation limiter |pu (base UNom)|
|UUelPu (optional) |output voltage of underexcitation limiter |pu (base UNom)|

The output signal is EfdPu, the excitation voltage in pu (user-selected base voltage).

## Model variant

In the ST5B model :

- the overexcitation and underexcitation limitation voltages are applied at the AVR input
- there is no stator current limiter

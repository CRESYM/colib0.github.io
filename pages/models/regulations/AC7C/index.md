# Exc IEEE AC7C model

## Context

This model consist of an ac alternator with either stationary or rotating rectifiers to produce the dc field requirements.Upgrades to earlier ac excitation systems, which replace only the controls but retain the ac alternator and diode rectifier bridge, have resulted in this new model.

This voltage regulator model first appeared in the IEEE Std 421.5-2016 {% cite IEEEExciterModels2016 %}. It has been reproduced identically in the IEC 61970-302:2024 version {% cite IECCIMForDynamics2024 %}.
In the previous standard version (2005), its predecessor model was called AC7B. Compared to AC7B, AC7C has additional options for connecting OEL and UEL inputs, and additional flexibility for the representation of the controlled rectifier power source.

## Model use, assumptions, validity domain and limitations

It takes into account loading effects. It can't allow the supply of negative field current. It takes into account saturation.

This model is satisfactory for large scale simulations. However, if this model is used to design phase lead networks for power system stabilizers, and the local mode is close to 3 Hz or higher, a more detailed treatment of the ac rotating exciter may be needed.

Excitation systems incorporating rotating machines produce a field voltage output ($$E_{FD}$$) which is proportional to the rotating speed of the machine. Since this effect is negligible when speed deviations are small which is the case of dynamic studies of large interconnected power systems, the effect of speed deviations on the output of the dc rotating exciter models is not represented in this latest version of the standard. However, some commercial software may have implemented such speed dependency in their model.

## Model inputs and output

The input variables are :

| Variable | Description | Units |
|-----------|--------------| ------|
|IrPu | rotor current | pu (base SNom, user-selected base voltage)|
|itPu |complex current at the terminal |pu (base SNom, UNom)|
|UsPu |measured stator voltage |pu (base UNom)|
|UsRefPu |reference stator voltage |pu (base UNom)|
|utPu |complex voltage at the terminal |pu (base UNom)|
|UOelPu (optional) |output voltage of overexcitation limiter |pu (base UNom)|
|UPssPu (optional) |output voltage of power system stabilizer |pu (base UNom)|
|USclOelPu (optional) |output voltage of stator current overexcitation limiter |pu (base UNom)|
|USclUelPu (optional) |output voltage of stator current underexcitation limiter |pu (base UNom)|
|UUelPu (optional) |output voltage of underexcitation limiter |pu (base UNom)|

The output signal is EfdPu, the excitation voltage in pu (user-selected base voltage).

## Model variant

In the AC7B model :

- there are no overexcitation limiter and no stator current limiter
- the power system stabilizer and the underexcitation limiter output voltages are added to the voltage error
- the available exciter field voltage is proportional to the absolute terminal voltage

# Author's guidelines

This page provides some general writing guidelines for authors of the page. This page takes inspiration from {% cite EditorialStyleManualAuthors %},  {% cite EditingMathematics %}, {% cite Chicago:ManualOfStyle %}, {% cite StandardDictionary %}.

## Peer Review

Two reviews will be proposed for each article addition/modification:

- A first review will be based on the form, the quality of the explanations and compliance with the template and guidelines. For example, correction or question of grammatical errors, obvious inconsistencies or omissions, spelling, and punctuation.
- A second review will be based on the technical background, the accuracy and consistency  of the equations

## Writing principles

Depending on the nature of the page, the model or the test case template should be used. in both cases, the writing principles are the same.

### Title

 Please refer to chapter 2 part A of the {% cite EditorialStyleManualAuthors %}

### Tags

 All pages should contain tags, which are keywords provided by the author and that will automatically be detected by the search function of the website. The tags are listed after the tag keyword in the Markdown metadata block.

### Nomenclature

When nomenclature is needed, it should appear in a decicated section of the page, preferably at the beginning of the page.

### Equations

When the equation is at the beginning of an item, align the equal sign with the right-hand side capitals, end  the equation with a period, begin the definition with a capital, and end with a period.

When the equation is at the end of an item, end the definition with a comma, follow with an equal sign and  the rest of the equation, then end with a period as shown in the following example.

Consecutive Numbering: Equations within an article are numbered consecutively from the beginning of the  article to the end.
Appendix Equations: Continued consecutive numbering of equations is best in the Appendix, but equation  numbering that starts over with (A1), (A2), etc., for Appendix equations is permissible.

 Material in displayed equations is automatically italic unless you indicate otherwise. Some simple general rules apply. All variables are italic. Function names and abbreviations are Roman, as are units, unit abbreviations, complete words, and abbreviations of words. Superscripts and subscripts follow this same formula: when they are variables, they are italic; when they are abbreviations of words (such as “in” and “out” for input and output), they are Roman. Single-letter superscripts and subscripts may be italic even if they are abbreviations, unless this leads to inconsistency between italic and Roman characters for similar types of subscripts.

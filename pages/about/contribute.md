Please follow the prerequisites to begin the project.

- Verify your changes: 
    - `git status`: Check the status of your local repository to see what files have been modified, staged, or are untracked.
    - Code review : Review your changes to ensure quality and adherence to standards.
    - Testing     : Run any relevant tests to ensure your changes haven't introduced any regressions or errors.
- Preparing for push:
    - Before pushing any updates, authentify yourself using `git config --global user.email *you@example.com*` and `git config --global user.name *Your name*`


## Create an issue and related branch: <a id="create-an-issue-and-related-branch"></a>

A dedicated issue template should be proposed to you depending on the type of issue.
    
- create a branch using the issue number: `git checkout -b issue_number_name_of_new_branch`

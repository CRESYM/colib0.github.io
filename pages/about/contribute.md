Please follow the prerequisites to begin the project.

## Create an issue and related branch: <a id="create-an-issue-and-related-branch"></a>

- Create an issue before making any changes as it helps in tracking and managing contributions. 
  
- For any [post creation](https://github.com/CRESYM/colib0.github.io/issues/new?assignees=GJCRESYM%2C+matoubongrain&labels=enhancement%2Cnew+component&projects=Colib0&template=Add_Model_TestCases.yml&title=%5BModel%2F+Test+case+Name%5D%3A+), [modification](https://github.com/CRESYM/colib0.github.io/issues/new?assignees=GJCRESYM%2C+matoubongrain&labels=enhancement%2Cmodify+component&projects=Colib0&template=Modify_Model_TestCases.yml&title=%5BName%2FID+of+the+model%2F+test+case+to+be+improved%5D%3A+), [evaluation](https://github.com/CRESYM/colib0.github.io/issues/new?assignees=GJCRESYM%2C+matoubongrain&labels=enhancement%2Cbug%2Cevaluate+component&projects=Colib0&template=Evaluate.yml&title=%5BName%2FID+of+the+model%2F+test+case+to+be+evaluated%5D%3A+) or [reporting a bug](https://github.com/CRESYM/colib0.github.io/issues/new?assignees=GJCRESYM%2C+matoubongrain&labels=bug%2Ctriage&projects=Colib0&template=Report_Bug.yml&title=%5BBug%5D%3A+), please create an issue on the github space of the Colib project. A dedicated issue template should be proposed to you depending on the type of issue.
    
- Create a new branch with a naming convention: `issue_number_name_of_new_branch` (e.g- 116_modify_how_to_contribute)

- Please use the following [model template](/pages/templates/modelTemplate) and [test case template](/pages/templates/testCaseTemplate) for your reference.

- Verify your changes: 
    - `git status`: Check the status of your local repository to see what files have been modified, staged, or are untracked.
    - Code review : Review your changes to ensure quality and adherence to standards.
    - Testing     : Run any relevant tests to ensure your changes haven't introduced any regressions or errors.
  
- Preparing for push:
    - Push your updated branch to [Colib repository](https://github.com/CRESYM/colib0.github.io/branches).

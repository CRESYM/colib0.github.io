  abstract = {In this paper, the problem of real implementation of a transmission grid was addressed. In today’s modern society, electricity is the most important form of energy for industry and society. A reliable and stable electrical power system is therefore essential. The growing amount of renewable energy sources leads to wheeling electrical power over long distances and to the growth in power electronics-based generation. Both affect the behavior of the electrical power system. The objective of this paper is the development of a scaled version of the Kundur’s two areas system in order to implement it in a real laboratory. Additionally, this setup allows to change the rotational inertia and analyze all terminal quantities with phasor measurement units. The control structure of this island grid should reflect the reality as close as possible. All this together enables to study dynamic phenomena with a real small power system. With this laboratory implementation electromechanical swings such as inter-area oscillations after disconnecting a tie-line, changing loads and generation or tripping a synchronous machine can be shown.},

  abstract = {An authoritative guide to the most up-to-date information on power system dynamics The revised third edition ofPower System Dynamics and Stabilitycontains a comprehensive, state-of-the-art review of information on the topic. The third edition continues the successful approach of the first and second editions by progressing from simplicity to complexity. It places the emphasis first on understanding the underlying physical principles before proceeding to more complex models and algorithms. The book is illustrated by a large number of diagrams and examples. The third edition ofPower System Dynamics and Stabilityexplores the influence of wind farms and virtual power plants, power plants inertia and control strategy on power system stability. The authorsnoted experts on the topiccover a range of new and expanded topics including: Wide-area monitoring and control systems. Improvement of power system stability by optimization of control systems parameters. Impact of renewable energy sources on power system dynamics. The role of power system stability in planning of power system operation and transmission network expansion. Real regulators of synchronous generators and field tests. Selectivity of power system protections at power swings in power system. Criteria for switching operations in transmission networks. Influence of automatic control of a tap changing step-up transformer on the power capability area of the generating unit. Mathematical models of power system components such as HVDC links, wind and photovoltaic power plants. Data of sample (benchmark) test systems. Power System Dynamics: Stability and Control, Third Editionis an essential resource for students of electrical engineering and for practicing engineers and researchers who need the most current information available on the topic.},

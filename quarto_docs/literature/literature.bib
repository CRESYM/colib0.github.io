  abstract = {In this paper, the problem of real implementation of a transmission grid was addressed. In today’s modern society, electricity is the most important form of energy for industry and society. A reliable and stable electrical power system is therefore essential. The growing amount of renewable energy sources leads to wheeling electrical power over long distances and to the growth in power electronics-based generation. Both affect the behavior of the electrical power system. The objective of this paper is the development of a scaled version of the Kundur’s two areas system in order to implement it in a real laboratory. Additionally, this setup allows to change the rotational inertia and analyze all terminal quantities with phasor measurement units. The control structure of this island grid should reflect the reality as close as possible. All this together enables to study dynamic phenomena with a real small power system. With this laboratory implementation electromechanical swings such as inter-area oscillations after disconnecting a tie-line, changing loads and generation or tripping a synchronous machine can be shown.},

The authors show that by applying a detailed analysis of the generator equations and the converter control design, a reduction of the model complexity is possible while maintaining a high level of accuracy. The generator model presented in this paper allows an improved representation of the stationary and dynamic response of wind turbines equipped with DFG systems especially during grid faults and during voltage recovery. The model is designed to represent modern DFG systems independently of vendor specific hardware and software. The results of simulations are compared to measurements of a voltage dip involving wind turbines. The generator model has been proposed as extension to the WECC/IEEE generator models and has been accepted as reference for IEC TC88 working group 27 (standard IEC 61400-27-1) on modeling and model validation of wind turbines.},

  abstract = {Methods of modelling power systems in the study of the system transient behaviour are reviewed. Six machine models of varying complexity are developed from the fundamental machine equations. Factors in the form of the machine equations, which critically influence the economy of solution, are identified. The relationship between the machine and system equations is examined in relation to the digital solution of multimachine problems, and generalised methods of solution of the equations are outlined. Comparisons are made between results obtained from the range of machine models and those obtained from full-scale fault-throwing tests on the public supply system. In one case, a single machine connected to a system of high capacity is modelled, while, in the second example, two 60 MW machines connected to a large mulrimachine system is modelled. Both non-pole-slipping and pole-slipping tests for the case of the 2-machine system are examined, in which a machine marginally remained in synchronism and marginally lost synchronism, respectively. It is shown that models in which subtransient phenomena are simulated, but in which some transformer voltages in the stator equations, together with subtransient saliency, are neglected, provide an adequate and economical model for system disturbances, including those in which the machine may fall from synchronism.},

These models are required by power system operators to conduct the planning and operation activities of their networks since the use of detailed manufacturer models is not practical. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the work done in this field, based on the results obtained by IEC and WECC working groups in the course of their research, which have motivated the publication of the IEC 61400-27 in February 2015. The final published versions of the generic models developed according to the existing four wind turbine technology types are detailed, highlighting the subsequent changes made during the development phase. The main differences between IEC and WECC generic models are also analyzed. Not only is the final model structure presented but we also provide a complete description of the physical behavior of wind turbines facing power system stability problems. Results are thus of great interest to grid operators, software developers, wind farm owners and researchers focused on the integration of wind energy into power systems.},

Extensive results are also included to explore the influence of these parameters on the model dynamic response. This work thus provides an extensive analysis of the generic Type 3 wind turbine model and provides an estimation of parameters not previously discussed in the specific literature. Indeed, the International Standard IEC 61400-27-1, recently published in February 2015, defines these generic dynamic simulation models for wind turbines, but does not provide values for the parameters to simulate the response of these models. Thus, there is a pressing need to establish correlations between IEC generic models and specific wind turbine manufacturer models to estimate suitable parameters for simulation purposes.

  abstract = {The widespread use of renewable energies around the world has generated the need for new tools and resources to allow them to be properly integrated into current power systems. Power system operators need new dynamic generic models of wind turbines and wind farms adaptable to any vendor topology and which permit transient stability analysis of their networks with the required accuracy. Under this framework, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) have developed their own generic dynamic models of wind turbines for stability analysis. Although these entities work in conjunction, the focus of each is slightly different. The WECC models attempt to minimise the complexity and number of parameters needed, while the IEC approach aims to optimise comparison with real turbine measurements. This study presents a detailed comparison between these two different approaches for modeling a Type 3 (i.e., DFIG) wind turbine in MATLAB/Simulink. Finally, several simulations are conducted, with which the consequences of the different approaches are evaluated. The results of this paper are of interest to power system operators as well as wind turbine manufacturers who require further assistance in adapting their specific models to the simplified versions provided by the International Committees.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the effects of increased wind power penetration by doubly fed asynchronous generators (DFAGs) on oscillation damping are investigated. With the help of an illustrative example, it is shown that the general trend for DFAGs is to increase interarea oscillation damping. However, there are exceptions for certain penetration levels (not necessarily large), for which the voltage control (VC) option of DFAGs can reduce damping. It is also shown that the modulation of active power generation of wind turbines is a powerful tool to introduce additional damping to interarea oscillations through a simple wind power system stabilizer design. The general trend for increased oscillation damping is verified in the case of a large interconnected system encompassing Southeastern Europe for a projected high level of wind penetration in Greece. For the same system, it is also shown that lowdamping voltage oscillations possibly introduced by the VC mode of DFAGs can be adequately damped by properly adjusting control parameters.},

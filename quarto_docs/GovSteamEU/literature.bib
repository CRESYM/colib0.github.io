  abstract = {The steam turbine generator is the primary power conversion component of the power plant. The function of the steam turbine generator is to convert the thermal energy of the steam from the steam generator to electrical energy. Two separate components are provided: the steam turbine to convert the thermal energy to rotating mechanical energy, and the generator to convert the mechanical energy to electrical energy. Typically, the turbine is directly coupled to the generator.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the problem of real implementation of a transmission grid was addressed. In today‚Äôs modern society, electricity is the most important form of energy for industry and society. A reliable and stable electrical power system is therefore essential. The growing amount of renewable energy sources leads to wheeling electrical power over long distances and to the growth in power electronics-based generation. Both affect the behavior of the electrical power system. The objective of this paper is the development of a scaled version of the Kundur‚Äôs two areas system in order to implement it in a real laboratory. Additionally, this setup allows to change the rotational inertia and analyze all terminal quantities with phasor measurement units. The control structure of this island grid should reflect the reality as close as possible. All this together enables to study dynamic phenomena with a real small power system. With this laboratory implementation electromechanical swings such as inter-area oscillations after disconnecting a tie-line, changing loads and generation or tripping a synchronous machine can be shown.},

  author = {Franke, Martin and Guironnet, Adrien and Cardozo, Carmen},
  date = {2024},
  abstract = {To ensure power system stability in the presence of a high penetration of power-electronic interfaced resources, Transmission System Operators (TSOs) require access to transparent, reliable and validated dynamic models to be able to conduct comprehensive large-scale studies. One possible approach is the utilization of so-called generic models that offer a modular structure capable of representing a wide range of installations by appropriately adjusting the parameters. This paper provides a thorough comparison of the two predominant generic models for Type 4 Wind Turbine (WT), developed by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and the Western Electric Coordinating Council (WECC), respectively. It highlights both the shared functionalities and the notable differences between these models, offering insights into their applicability. Furthermore, this analysis identifies unresolved questions regarding their implementation, emphasizing the need for further clarification to ensure a common understanding of their structure and consistent behavior across different tools.},

  abstract = {Methods of modelling power systems in the study of the system transient behaviour are reviewed. Six machine models of varying complexity are developed from the fundamental machine equations. Factors in the form of the machine equations, which critically influence the economy of solution, are identified. The relationship between the machine and system equations is examined in relation to the digital solution of multimachine problems, and generalised methods of solution of the equations are outlined. Comparisons are made between results obtained from the range of machine models and those obtained from full-scale fault-throwing tests on the public supply system. In one case, a single machine connected to a system of high capacity is modelled, while, in the second example, two 60 MW machines connected to a large mulrimachine system is modelled. Both non-pole-slipping and pole-slipping tests for the case of the 2-machine system are examined, in which a machine marginally remained in synchronism and marginally lost synchronism, respectively. It is shown that models in which subtransient phenomena are simulated, but in which some transformer voltages in the stator equations, together with subtransient saliency, are neglected, provide an adequate and economical model for system disturbances, including those in which the machine may fall from synchronism.},
